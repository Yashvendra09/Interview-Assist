# Video Interview Proctoring System

A comprehensive AI-powered video interview proctoring solution with real-time face detection, gaze tracking, and object detection capabilities. Built with React, TypeScript, and advanced ML models for reliable monitoring.

## üöÄ Features

### Core Proctoring Capabilities
- **Continuous Video Recording**: Chunked recording with IndexedDB storage for sessions > 10 minutes
- **Real-time Face Detection**: MediaPipe Face Mesh for robust face tracking
- **Gaze Tracking**: Advanced head pose estimation to detect when candidates look away
- **Object Detection**: TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD model to identify prohibited items
- **Multi-face Detection**: Instant alerts when multiple people are detected
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive timestamped event system with severity levels

### Performance & Reliability
- **Web Worker Architecture**: Heavy ML inference offloaded from main thread
- **Adaptive Frame Rates**: Face detection at 8 FPS, object detection at 2 FPS
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback mechanisms when models fail to load
- **Memory Management**: Chunked video storage prevents memory overflow
- **Cross-browser Support**: WebRTC and MediaRecorder API compatibility

### Reporting & Analytics
- **Live Event Dashboard**: Real-time violation monitoring with severity indicators
- **Downloadable Reports**: CSV and PDF export with detailed analytics
- **Professional Formatting**: Branded PDF reports with event summaries
- **Data Persistence**: IndexedDB storage for offline capability

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **ML Models**: 
  - MediaPipe Face Mesh (face/gaze detection)
  - TensorFlow.js + COCO-SSD (object detection)
- **Recording**: WebRTC getUserMedia + MediaRecorder API
- **Storage**: IndexedDB via LocalForage
- **Reports**: jsPDF for PDF generation
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui with custom design system

## üìã Detection Algorithms

### Face & Gaze Detection
- **No Face Threshold**: 10 seconds
- **Looking Away Threshold**: 5 seconds  
- **Multiple Face Detection**: Instant alert
- **Gaze Estimation**: Head pose analysis using facial landmarks
- **Smoothing**: Rolling average over 0.5s to reduce jitter

### Object Detection
- **Prohibited Items**: Cell phones, laptops, books, tablets, keyboards
- **Confidence Threshold**: 45%
- **Debouncing**: Prevents duplicate alerts for persistent objects
- **Performance**: 2-3 FPS inference rate for optimal CPU usage

## üìä Event Types & Severity Levels

### Violation Events (High Severity)
- **Multiple Faces**: More than one person detected
- **No Face**: Face absent for > 10 seconds
- **Phone Detected**: Cell phone in camera view

### Behavior Events (Medium Severity)  
- **Looking Away**: Gaze diverted for > 5 seconds
- **Object Detected**: Books, laptops, or other items

### System Events (Low Severity)
- **Recording Started/Stopped**
- **Model Loading Status**
- **Camera Initialization**

## üéõÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Detection Thresholds (Configurable)
```typescript
const settings = {
  lookAwayThreshold: 5,        // seconds
  noFaceThreshold: 10,         // seconds
  objectConfidence: 0.45,      // 45% minimum
  faceDetectionFPS: 8,         // frames per second
  objectDetectionFPS: 2        // frames per second
};
```

### Recording Settings
```typescript
const recordingOptions = {
  mimeType: 'video/webm;codecs=vp9,opus',
  videoBitsPerSecond: 2500000,  // 2.5 Mbps
  audioBitsPerSecond: 128000,   // 128 kbps
  chunkInterval: 3000          // 3 second chunks
};
```

## üß™ Testing & Quality Assurance

### Acceptance Test Checklist
- [ ] 12+ minute continuous recording without failure
- [ ] Looking away detection triggers after 5 seconds
- [ ] No-face detection triggers after 10 seconds  
- [ ] Multiple face detection is instantaneous
- [ ] Phone detection works within 1 second of appearance
- [ ] CSV export contains all required fields
- [ ] PDF report generates successfully
- [ ] Models load with progress indication
- [ ] Graceful handling of camera permission denial

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Model Load Time**: < 10 seconds on average connection
- **Detection Latency**: < 200ms for face detection
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB for 30-minute session
- **CPU Usage**: < 30% on modern hardware

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Local-Only Processing**: No data sent to external servers
- **Client-Side ML**: All detection runs in browser
- **Secure Storage**: IndexedDB with automatic cleanup
- **No Network Dependencies**: Works offline after initial load

## üöß Known Limitations

1. **Model Loading**: Requires stable internet for initial model download
2. **Browser Support**: Limited to modern browsers with WebRTC support
3. **Lighting Conditions**: Face detection accuracy depends on lighting
4. **Mobile Performance**: Resource-intensive on mobile devices
5. **Storage Limits**: Browser quota limits for very long sessions

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements
